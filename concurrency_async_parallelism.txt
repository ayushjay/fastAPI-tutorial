Modern versions of Python have support for "asynchronous code" using something called "coroutines", with async and await syntax.\

When we can switch to other tasks from first task when first task is taking extra time(like heavy ML/Data Science work),
it is called concurrency.

Sequential tasks: 
if i waited in line for airport for 4 hours and later did work for 3 hours= sequential 

concurrency
for example- if i have to go to the airport and wait in line, where airport line=4 hours and office work = 3 hours(Total of 7)
But, whenever i was not busy with airport line work and did office work, and finally at end of day work is done= Concurrency
work is interruptable, as in i can pick up task1 after task2 is done

parallelism:
when two tasks are literally performed at the same time, it is called parallelism.
If my assistant does work while i'm in line= parallel

Couroutines = fancy term for async def
